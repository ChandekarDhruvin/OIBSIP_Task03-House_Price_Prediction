# OIBSIP_Task03-House_Price_Prediction

**Linear Regression Project**

**Objective:** Developed and evaluated a predictive model using linear regression to estimate house prices based on relevant features.

**Project Highlights:**

- **Data Collection:** Obtained a dataset containing numerical features and a target variable for prediction.
- **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Explored dataset structure, handled missing values, and ensured data quality. Utilized one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
- **Feature Selection:** Identified relevant features contributing to the predictive model and handled outliers using z-score method.
- **Model Training:** Implemented linear regression using Scikit-Learn, split the dataset into training and testing sets, and standardized features using StandardScaler.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance on a separate test dataset using Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and overall model score.
- **Visualization:** Created visualizations to illustrate the relationship between predicted and actual house prices, and visualized correlations between actual and predicted prices.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
